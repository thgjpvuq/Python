## Python Projects
These Python projects focus on analyzing data sets using only Python's base package.
The .csv files are read using Python's built-in CSV module. The purpose for using only Python's
base packages is to learn how to do data analysis only using base Python and to better understand
the how packages such as NumPy and pandas work and make the data analysis process easier and more
efficient.
